                        We urge towards proactivity, and proactivity means being physically present whenever assistance is needed for domestic projects.

                        And there we areâ€¦ located in one of the most attractive administrative areas of the Albanian capital, Tirana! You may find us at the best vicinity of the central business district, with rapid transit systems, full of dynamics and restlessness, and at the same time, just 3-minute walk away from the artificial lake of Tirana, the largest, open-air park of our metropolis.
